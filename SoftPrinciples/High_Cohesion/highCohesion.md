=> Define High Cohesion

High cohesion means that a class or module focuses on a single, well-defined responsibility. All its parts (methods, fields) work together to achieve one clear purpose, making the code easier to understand, maintain, and reuse.

=> "A class should do its own related work only (its well-defined responsibility) and avoid handling unrelated functionalities."
