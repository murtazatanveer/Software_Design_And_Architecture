=> Defination :

Dependency is the weakest and most temporary relationship between classes, where one class uses another class short-term without owning or managing its lifecycle.

=> Class A uses class B for specific purpose (in its method) parameter , local variable or return type.

=> A dependency occurs when Class A uses Class B for a specific task (in its method) without owning or managing its lifecycle. Class B is passed as a parameter, created as a local variable, or returned by Class A.

=> Dependency can be built through

1. Method Parameters
2. Local Variables
3. Return Types
