=> Defination:

Association is a relationship between two classes where one class knows about and uses another class, but does not control its lifecycle. It's a "has-a" relationship that can be either unidirectional or bidirectional.

=> The difference between dependency and association is that in association class A uses class B as attributes while in dependeny class A uses class B as a method parameters , local variables or return type.

=> Types of Association

1. Unidirectional Association (One-Way)
2. Bidirectional Association (Two-Way)

=> One-to-Many vs. Many-to-One Association

1. One-to-Many (1:N)

Definition: One instance of Class A is associated with multiple instances of Class B.

Real-World Analogy: A Department has many Employees.


2. Many-to-One (N:1)

Definition: Many instances of Class A reference one instance of Class B.

Real-World Analogy: Many Students belong to one School.
